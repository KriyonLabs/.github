# 🚀 Kriyon Labs

**From Action to Automation**

Kriyon Labs is an **automation-first AI agency** that identifies **niche, manual, and repetitive workflows** and converts them into **intelligent, scalable systems**.

We don’t build AI for hype.  
We build **automation that actually works**.

---

## 🧠 What We Do

At Kriyon Labs, we focus on:
- Finding **operational bottlenecks**
- Breaking processes into **clear, automatable steps**
- Building **rule-based systems first**
- Using **AI only where it adds real value**

Our work is driven by **practical impact**, not buzzwords.

---

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

> **If a task is repetitive, rule-driven, and wastes human time — it can be automated.**

Every Kriyon project follows this approach:
1. Understand the workflow deeply  
2. Simplify before automating  
3. Automate incrementally  
4. Document everything clearly  

---

## 🧩 Domains We Automate

- Clinic & healthcare operations  
- Business process automation (BPA)  
- ERP & internal tooling  
- Workflow orchestration  
- AI-assisted decision systems  

We deliberately focus on **specific niches**, not generic solutions.

## 🏗 How We Build Systems

Typical architecture at Kriyon Labs:

```

User / Input
↓
Backend APIs
↓
Automation Engine (rules + logic)
↓
Database
↓
Dashboards / Notifications / Integrations

```

AI components are added **only when justified** (e.g., NLP, classification, prediction).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

All Kriyon repositories follow a consistent structure:

```

/docs        → problem understanding & workflows
/frontend    → UI (if required)
/backend     → APIs & business logic
/automation  → core automation rules & engines
/ml          → AI models (optional)

```

Consistency helps teams move fast and avoid confusion.

## 🚀 Current Focus

🔹 **Clinic Automation**

Automating patient registration, appointment scheduling, follow-ups, and internal clinic operations for small to mid-scale clinics.

This serves as:
- A real-world automation case
- A reusable system blueprint
- The foundation for future healthcare automations

---

## 🏷 About the Name

**Kriyon** comes from *Kriya* — meaning **action or process**.  
Kriyon Labs exists to transform **actions into automated systems**.

---

## 📌 Status

Kriyon Labs is in **active build mode**.  
Projects are evolving, systems are modular, and documentation is a priority.
